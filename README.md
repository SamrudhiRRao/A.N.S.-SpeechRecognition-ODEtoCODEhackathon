# A.N.S.-SpeechRecognition-ODEtoCODEhackathon

Created on 5th June

We have created a python bot that can listen and capture our audio and then later converts it into text.
The text is compared with the vocabulary which has disease names. If a word from the text is a part of our vocabulory of diseases then it is stored in a list and then later printed. 
The following is the output of our bot:

We Plan to create a speech analysis module (Web Based) where certain questions such as below could be asked by the system(text form), and the specific intent of the answer should be displayed
.E.g.,
Question:- “Do you suffer from any health diseases?”
Possible Speech Answers:- “Yes, I suffer from Diabetes”, “Diabetes”, “No, i don’t have any diseases”, “I have heart disease and diabetes”, etc.

We plan to cover all of the following questions:
1. Do you suffer from any health diseases?
2. What’s your annual income?
3. What is your dob?
