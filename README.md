# A.N.S.-SpeechRecognition-ODEtoCODEhackathon

Created on 5th June

We have created a python bot that can listen and capture our audio and then later converts it into text.
The text is compared with the vocabulary which has disease names. If a word from the text is a part of our vocabulory of diseases then it is stored in a list and then later printed.
